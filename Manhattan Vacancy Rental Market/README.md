# File Title: Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Project

This is the first project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned about Advanced Spreadsheets. This project is about analyzing Airbnb listings in Manhattan, NYC to help a client decide what type of vacation rental property to invest in.

#### Process:
1) **Data Preparation**: *Filtering* techniques were used to identify and clean inconsistencies within the Airbnb data. Irrelevant columns were hidden to maintain a focused analysis. Key functions such as PROPER, TRIM, IF, ISNUMBER, FIND, ROUND, SUMIF, VLOOKUP, CHOOSE, and WEEKDAY were employed for data tidying.
2) **Neighborhood Analysis**: Identify the top-performing neighborhoods based on review frequency via *Pivot Table*.
3) **Property Size Analysis**: Determine the optimal property sizes for each neighborhoodvia *Pivot Table* showcased with *conditional formatting*.
4) **Revenue Analysis**: Calculate estimated annual revenue for the most attractive listings.
5) **Additional Optional Analysis**: Perform Analysis through *Pivot Tables* for occupancy rates by day, price by super host status, check-in ratings by use of doormen, and price by review ratings.
6) **Data Visualization**: Create clear and informative *visualizations* (charts) to present findings.
7) **Formatting and Organization**: Ensure your analysis is well-formatted for ease of readability.

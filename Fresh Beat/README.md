# File Title: Fresh Beats Project Status Report

This was an optional project I worked on after the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned about Business Intelligence. 

Fresh Beats is a music streaming platform catering to listeners and up-and-coming musicians. It offers music streaming and helps new artists gain exposure through promotional services.
The platform faces challenges in optimizing these areas:

- Ensuring artist promotions are effective and deliver value for musicians.
- Converting free listeners into paying subscribers.
- Recommending music effectively, especially for highlighting new artists in relevant genres.
